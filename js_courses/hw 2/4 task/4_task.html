            <p>Roger Federer is a Swiss professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 3 in men's singles
                tennis by the
                Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).[2] He has won 20 Grand Slam singles titles—the most in
                history for a male player—and
                has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for a record total of 310 weeks, including a record
                237
                consecutive weeks. After turning professional in 1998, he was continuously ranked in the top ten from
                October
                2002 to November 2016. He re-entered the top ten following his victory at the 2017 Australian Open.</p>
            <p>Federer has won a men's record eight Wimbledon titles, a joint-record six Australian Open titles, a
                record five
                consecutive US Open titles, and one French Open title. He is one of eight men to have achieved a career
                Grand Slam.
                Federer has reached a record 30 men's singles Grand Slam finals, including 10 in a row from the 2005
                Wimbledon Championships
                to the 2007 US Open. Federer has also won a record six ATP Finals, 27 ATP World Tour Masters 1000
                titles, and a record
                21 ATP World Tour 500 titles.</p>

        Federer's all-court game and versatile style of play involve exceptional footwork and shot-making.[3] Effective
        both as a base-liner and a volleyer,
        his apparent effortlessness and efficient movement on the court have made Federer highly popular among tennis
        fans.
        He has received the tour Sportsmanship Award 13 times and been named the ATP Player of the Year and ITF World
        Champion five times.
