        Song: Adele "Hello"<br><br>
        [Verse 1]<br>
        Hello, it's me<br>
        I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet<br>
        To go over everything<br>
        They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing<br>
        Hello, can you hear me?<br>
        I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be<br>
        When we were younger and free<br>
        I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet<br><br>

        [Pre-Chorus 1]
        There's such a difference between us<br>
        And a million miles<br><br>

        [Chorus]<br>
        Hello from the other side<br>
        I must've called a thousand times<br>
        To tell you, I'm sorry for everything that I've done<br>
        But when I call, you never seem to be home<br>
        Hello from the outside<br>
        At least, I can say that I've tried<br>
        To tell you, I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
        But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore<br><br>

        [Verse 2]<br>
        Hello, how are you?<br>
        It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry<br>
        I hope that you're well<br>
        Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?<br>
